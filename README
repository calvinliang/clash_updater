A simple project that my Philip Lorenzo, asked if I could work on.

It would basically read two files and append the grid line locations from the first file to a particular location on the second 
file, and create a new third file with both changes. This was written in C++.

I wanted to create a GUI on top of it, and finalized my decision on using wxWidgets (http://www.wxwidgets.org/) due to a 
recommendation from Edward Wu. wxWidgets is a C++ library that allows developers to create cross-platform applications. I am 
using wxDev-C++, which is Dev-C++ with an extension to work alongside wxWidgets (http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/).

I am currently working on the GUI, so any suggestions or criticism would be appreciated.
